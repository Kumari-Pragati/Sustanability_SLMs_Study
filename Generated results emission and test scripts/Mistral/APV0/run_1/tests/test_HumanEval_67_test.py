Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_67_code import fruit_distribution
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    """
    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit. This basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represents the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket, return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    
    For example:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) -> 19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19
    """
    lis = []
    for i in s.split(' '):
        if i.isdigit():
            lis.append(int(i))
    return n - sum(lis)

 Here is a simple unittest test script for the `fruit_distribution` function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_67_code import fruit_distribution

class TestFruitDistribution(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_fruit_distribution(self):
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19), 8)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3), 2)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100), 95)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120), 19)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("1 apple and 0 oranges", 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 0 oranges", 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("1000000000000000000 apples and 1 oranges", 1000000000000000002), 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test script includes a test case for the example provided in the function description, as well as some additional test cases to ensure the function works correctly for a variety of inputs. The test cases cover scenarios where the number of apples and oranges is zero, the number of fruits in the basket is zero, and a large number of apples and a small number of oranges.
