    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges 
    that are distributed in a basket of fruit. This basket contains 
    apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of 
    the oranges and apples and an integer that represents the total number of the fruits 
    in the basket, return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
    
    For example:
    fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) -> 19 - 5 - 6 = 8
    fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3) -> 3 - 0 - 1 = 2
    fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) -> 100 - 2 - 3 = 95
    fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120) -> 120 - 100 - 1 = 19

import unittest

# Function to be tested
from HumanEval_67_code import fruit_distribution

class TestFruitDistribution(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_fruit_distribution(self):
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19), 8)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3), 2)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100), 95)
        self.assertEqual(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120), 19)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This code snippet defines a `TestFruitDistribution` class within the `unittest` module, which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. The `test_fruit_distribution` method tests the `fruit_distribution` function with various inputs to ensure it returns the correct output. If any of these tests fail, the corresponding assertion will raise an error, indicating that there's something wrong with the implementation of the `fruit_distribution` function.
