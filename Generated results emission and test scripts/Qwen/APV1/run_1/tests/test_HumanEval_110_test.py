You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_110_code import exchange

3. End with:

    unittest.main()

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.

import unittest
from HumanEval_110_code import exchange

class TestExchange(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_exchange(self):
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]), "YES")
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]), "NO")
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 3, 5, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8]), "YES")
        self.assertEqual(exchange([1, 3, 5, 7], [1, 3, 5, 7]), "YES")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This code snippet defines a `TestExchange` class within the `unittest` framework, which contains a single method `test_exchange`. This method tests the `exchange` function using several test cases to ensure its correctness. The `assertEqual` methods compare the output of the `exchange` function against expected results, ensuring that the function behaves as intended across different scenarios.
