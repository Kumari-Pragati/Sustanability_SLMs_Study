You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_33_code import sort_third

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indices of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    l = list(l)
    l[::3] = sorted(l[::3])
    return l

import unittest

from HumanEval_33_code import sort_third

class TestSortThird(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_sort_third(self):
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([1, 2, 3]), [1, 2, 3], "Test case 1 failed")
        self.assertEqual(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5], "Test case 2 failed")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


In this solution, I've created a `unittest` test class named `TestSortThird`. The `test_sort_third` method contains two assertions to check if the `sort_third` function works as expected. If any assertion fails, it will raise an error indicating which test case failed. This ensures that the function behaves correctly according to the provided examples.
