Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_78_code import hex_key
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
        For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
        For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
        For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
        For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
        For num = "2020" the output should be 2.
    """

    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(num)):
        if num[i] in primes:
            total += 1
    return total

import unittest

# Function to check if a digit is prime
def is_prime(digit):
    return digit in {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}

class TestHexKey(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_hex_key(self):
        self.assertEqual(hex_key("AB"), 1)
        self.assertEqual(hex_key("1077E"), 2)
        self.assertEqual(hex_key("ABED1A33"), 4)
        self.assertEqual(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0"), 6)
        self.assertEqual(hex_key("2020"), 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This script imports `unittest` module, defines the `hex_key` function, and includes a class `TestHexKey` with methods to test the correctness of the `hex_key` function using assertions. The `is_prime` helper function checks if a given digit is one of the prime hexadecimal digits. Finally, it runs all tests when executed directly.
