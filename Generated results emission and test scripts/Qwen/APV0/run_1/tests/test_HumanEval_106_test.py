Generate a unittest test script for the following Python function.
The script should fully test the function and be runnable directly.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_106_code import f
3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
    """

    ret = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            x = 1
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                x *= j
            ret += [x]
        else:
            x = 0
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                x += j
            ret += [x]
    return ret

This script imports `unittest` module, defines the function `f`, and includes a test case class `TestF` with a method `test_f`. The `test_f` method checks the correctness of the `f` function using assertEqual statements. Finally, it runs all tests when executed directly.
