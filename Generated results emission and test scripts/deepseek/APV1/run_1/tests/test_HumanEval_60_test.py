### Instruction:
You are an expert Python programmer.
Your task is to write a comprehensive unittest test suite for the given Python function.

### Output Formatting
1. Start with: import unittest
2. Include: from HumanEval_60_code import sum_to_n

3. End with:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Function:
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    return sum(range(n + 1))


### Response:
Here is a unittest test suite for the given Python function:


import unittest
from HumanEval_60_code import sum_to_n

class TestSumToN(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sum_to_n(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(30), 465)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(100), 5050)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(5), 15)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(10), 55)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(1), 1)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(sum_to_n(-10), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()


This test suite includes tests for various inputs, including positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers. The `assertEqual` method is used to check if the output of the `sum_to_n` function matches the expected result. If any of the tests fail, the unittest framework will report the failure, indicating that the function does not behave as expected for that particular input.
